Encore
======
Encore is an afterburner for the Rockstar halo finder. 
Given a path to a list of halos and dark matter particles, 
Encore calculates a plethora of observables.

The structure of this is very similar to the catalog_analysis
code in the repository of the same name, but this is more
ambitious and well thought out.

This code is still in development.

Usage
=====
At the moment, only the mass function generation is being produced.
